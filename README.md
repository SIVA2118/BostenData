## Project Structure

- **index.js**: A JavaScript file included as a module (functionality not shown in the README, but it could contain DOM manipulation, event handling, or other features).
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Features

- The project includes a `<div>` with the `id="app"` that is styled with:
  - Blue text color
  - Grooved border style
- External JavaScript module support via the `index.js` file.
